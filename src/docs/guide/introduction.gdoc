The Page Resources plugin provides the [Grails Resources plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/resources] with the ability to
use convention over configuration to define "page modules", which allow having page-specific
JavaScript/CSS/LESS resources.  This can drastically cut down on the number of resource modules that need to be
configured explicitly.
